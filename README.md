# Covid-19Data
A project to graph Covid-19 deaths and confirmed cases over time.

## Getting Started
Go to ```settings.py``` in the folder ```Covid19Data```.  
Then paste your Django ```SECRET_KEY``` and set ```DEBUG = FALSE```.  
Then in the directory where you ```manage.py``` file is (this should be your top level directory), run ```python3 manage.py runserver```.  
Click on the link that the terminal outputs and your project should be running locally.
